# Installation

This proof-of-concept uses python and Pyro5 to model a P2P filesharing network, simple-term-menu to power a command-line menu-driven interface, and regular shell scripts to manage the various network components concurrently.

``` shell
$ make build
```

# How to use

## In one terminal window

``` shell
$ jewel init [N]
```

This initializes the network (the fileserver and peers) by copying all of the necessary files to the ``live`` folder, overwriting any local changes. The argument ``N`` indicates how many peers you want.

Now spin up your network:

``` shell
$ jewel run [N]
```

This starts the nameserver, fileserver and peers. The ``N`` argument indicates how many of the peers you'd like to spin up.

## In another terminal window

``` shell
$ jewel do
```

This allows you to do things like have one peer store a file on another.

## Looking at things

All logs go to the first terminal window, the one where you ran ``jewel run``.

You can also ask the nameserver about live nodes on the network:

``` shell
$ pyro5-nsc list
```

You can inspect the files stored in each peer by looking in the ``disk`` folder in each peer, e.g. ``live/peer/disk``.

# The Code

## The Network

There are two main python modules -- ``peer.py`` and ``fileserver.py``. When deployed using ``jewel init``, these modules are placed in dedicated folders to model distinct nodes or machines on a network. These folders also each contain a ``disk`` subfolder that represents the node's hard drive.

Both of these modules use Pyro5 to interact over the network. This library allows us to do simple method invocations on remote objects -- a really seamless RPC framework, basically.

Besides these two modules, everything else is just supporting modules.

## The Interface

The ``do.py`` module is the user interface to this whole thing. It uses a nifty library called ``simple-term-menu``, and the selected options appear in the code as indexes that we can use to take appropriate action. Remember to ``jewel run`` first so that the network is up.

## Automation

Spinning up a network in various configurations would be time-consuming and error prone, so we use bash scripts to do it. Specifically, ``init.sh`` creates the network in the ``live`` directory by simply copying over files into distinct folders representing nodes or machines, and ``run.sh`` spins everything up once deployed. ``jewel init`` and ``jewel run`` simply delegate to these shell scripts.

This project follows Attribution-Based Economics as described in [drym-org/foundation](https://github.com/drym-org/foundation). Any financial contributions will be distributed to contributors and antecedents as agreed-upon in a collective process that anyone may participate in. To see the current distributions, take a look at [abe/attributions.txt](https://github.com/countvajhula/jewel/blob/main/abe/attributions.txt). To see payments made into and out of the project, see the [abe](https://github.com/countvajhula/jewel/blob/main/abe/) folder. If your payment is not reflected there within 3 days, or if you would prefer to, you are welcome to submit an issue or pull request to report the payment yourself -- all payments into and out of the repository are to be publicly reported (but may be anonymized if desired).

Additionally, if your voluntary payments exceed the agreed-upon "market price" of the project (see [price.txt](https://github.com/countvajhula/jewel/blob/main/abe/price.txt)), that additional amount will be treated as an investment, entitling you to a share in future revenues, including payments made to the project in the future or attributive revenue from other projects.

This project will distribute payments according to the ABE guidelines specified in the constitution. In particular, it may take up to 90 days to distribute the initial payments if DIA has not already been conducted for this project. After that, payments will be distributed to contributors (including investors) at each meeting of the [DIA congress](https://github.com/drym-org/dia-old-abe) (e.g. approximately quarterly).
